    <p>How it works:</p>
    <p>    - The graph represents the number of items found in Country-stats API and Discogs API relating to each country.</p>
    <p>    - The radius represents how many items are found in Country-stats API, while the angle points to the number of items found in Discogs API.</p>
    <p>    - Each country is also mapped to its ranking albums.</p>
